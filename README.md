# First JuptyerNotebook Data analysis
I had decided as my first project to create a data analysis set that would allow me to fix a video game data set. 
My hobby is around playing video games so I decided to choose a video game data set.
In my juptyer notebooks I used html code to show my pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn program that I used
to express my data. I had made visual representations and at the end of the program I had list the parts that I 
found the most difficult to complete and the things that were the easiest for me to figure out in my data. Overall,
I enjoyed finshing this data set as my first project.
